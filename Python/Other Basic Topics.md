Further Topics to Consider

Chapter 4 gives an application of Python to the web. It does not introduce new language features. We
have come to end of the new language features in this tutorial, but there are certainly more basic topics to
learn about programming and Python in particular, if you continue in other places:
(1) Creating your own kinds of objects (writing classes)
(2) Inheritance: Building new classes derived from existing classes

(4) Other syntax used with loops: break, continue, and else
(5) Exception handling
(6) Pythonâ€™s variable length parameter lists, and other options in parameter lists
(7) List comprehensions: a concise, readable, fast Pythonic way to make new lists from old ones
(8) Event handling in graphical programming
(9) Recursion (not special to Python): a powerful programming technique where functions call themselves
