UX

Softcopy:
Prototyping - Sample Version of the product/apps.
Wireframes - 2D representations of the design. Doesn't look very much like the end product.

Drawings:

Paper Prototype - Representation of the real sketch tru papers.
Sketchnoting - Paper Sketch. Hand draw infographics.
Navigation Map - functionality/structure on some details of prototype.
Low Fidelity - Not look very much.
Medium Fidelity - Black and White/Grayscale but clickable and uses scenario.
High Fidelity - Very close to the end Product.

Reference:
Mood Board - Mood boards are a good way to experiment with a color palette, fonts, and style as well as plan visual 
	     hierarchy of a project.
	   - A collection of assets and materials intended to communicate the style, voice, direction, and 
             language of a particular design, brand, or project.
